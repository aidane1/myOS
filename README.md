# myOS


## Purpose
This operating system was a self guided project to get a better understanding
of how computers (and of course operating systems) function. I followed a multitude
of different tutorials to pull this together, resulting in the product you see here.

Lessons learned include: 
- Building a cross compiler (gcc i386-elf)
- Assembling assembly into object files
- Linking object files into binaries/executables
